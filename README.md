## Techstack

 - HTML - CSS
 - Node.js
 - Express
 - MongoDB
 - Google OAuth 2.0

## Setting up project locally
Make sure you have `Node.js` environment setup on your system with `npm` package manager.  You need to register your forked version at Google Console and setup Google OAuth credentials to obtain necessary keys to run the project. You also need to setup MLab cloud database for MongoDB. Checkout `sample.env` to know more about which keys are needed to run the project.

## Running locally
 1. Clone the repository locally and go to the directory.
 2. Create `.env` file and provide all the necessary keys. Checkout `sample.env` for reference.
 3. Run `npm i`
 4. Run `npm start`


## Contributing
Currently I am not accepting any PRs, but you can fork the repo and maintain your own version.
